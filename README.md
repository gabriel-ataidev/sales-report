# SalesReport

This application shows a fictitious report of sales profits per month, you can see a print-screen below and the demonstration via the [link](https://2023-sales-report.netlify.app/). The graph changes as the user chooses the product brand and to bring more reliability to the application, unit tests were implemented and it also has a responsive layout.
